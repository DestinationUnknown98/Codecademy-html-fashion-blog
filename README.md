# 🧥 Fashion Blog

A simple HTML project created as part of Codecademy's **Full-Stack Developer** course. This project was initially developed following Codecademy's guidance, but as I progressed in the course and learned more, I decided to enhance and improve the project on my own.

## 📄 Project Overview

This project simulates a basic fashion blog webpage, built using **only HTML**. It showcases a blog post about New York Fashion Week (NYFW) and includes an "About Me" section, tips for attending the event, related content, and contact information.

### Features:
- Header with the author's name and date of publication.
- Multiple sections discussing different aspects of attending NYFW.
- Embedded images to support the content.
- Links to external resources (e.g., Wikipedia for NYFW).
- A contact section at the bottom with email and phone details.
